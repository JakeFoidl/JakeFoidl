Hello Potential Employers/Strangers, I’m @JakeFoidl (Jacob Foidl).

I studied Data Science at Brigham Young University-Idaho in the cold, cold wastes of Rexburg, Idaho. (I've seen most of the farms that Five Guys gets their potatoes from)

What I want to learn:
- Data Engineering
- Machine Learning

- An Excel Listening List. More than 1500+ Albums I want to listen to and continually growing.
- Record Collection about 100 at the moment
- Guitar
- DMing a DND Campaign. Been doing it for over a year now + 103 Pages of Notes in a Word docx.
